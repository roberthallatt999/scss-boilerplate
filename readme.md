# Sass Boilerplate

This boilerplate is borrowed from and inspired by https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/sass-boilerplate/tree/master. Additional functionality has been added to watch changes in the browser and version control CSS.

Each folder of this project has its own `README.md` file to explain the purpose and add extra information. Be sure to browse the repository to see how it works.

```bash
npm install
